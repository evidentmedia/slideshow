# Simple Slide-Show-App

A lightweight and simple browserbased app so to serve images and videos in the browser. 

We build this to easily make a slideshow of images and videos without having to render them as a video.

## Install
1. Place your image and video files in the media directory
2. CMD `docker-compose up`
3. Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser

PHP is only used to read the directory. Alternatively, a media list can be created and used. 

## Usage
- Press `Play` to start the slideshow in fullscreen-mode
- Press `ESC` to leave fullscreen. 
- Click anything to re-enter fullscreen.
